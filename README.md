Custom Character Generator for HD44780 LCD Modules
(edited by Cooper)

Usage
-----
My updated generator is available [here](http://omerk.github.com/lcdchargen/).

Click on the blocks to create a custom character which will automatically generate output.

The example Arduino code generated defaults with the following connections:


| LCD Module    | Arduino Pin   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| RS            | 12            |
| RW            | GND           |
| Enable        | 11            |
| D4            | 5             |
| D5            | 4             |
| D6            | 3             |
| D7            | 2             |
